Python simple text inflectional dictionaries library

About
-----

PyDic is a set of shell tools (being also python modules) for managing simple
inflectional dictionaries. It uses own dictionary format based on Berkeley DB
and Marisa Trie data structures. Dictionaries can be easily build with provided
tools from raw UTF-8 text files in simple format.

PyDic supports using multiple different dictionaries at the same time.
