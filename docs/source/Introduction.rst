Introduction
============

PyDic is a python module for accessing inflectional dictionaries. It uses own dictionary format based on Berkeley DB
data structures. Dictionaries can be easily build with provided tools from raw UTF-8 text files in simple format.

PyDic supports using multiple different dictionaries at the same time, using handy convention that each dictionary
is a set of files in a single directory.
